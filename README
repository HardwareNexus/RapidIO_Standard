There are currently two scripts which generate files:

check_all_checklists runs parse_checklists.py on all checklist XML files,
   and merges the results.

check_all_outlines runs parse_rapidio_standard.py on all XML files for
   RapidIO standard revisiions to create outlines, and then creates
   files to capture the deltas between the different outlines.
   This is a quick way to check what should have changed between
   specification revisions, and can be used as the basis of
   translation files between various revisions.
