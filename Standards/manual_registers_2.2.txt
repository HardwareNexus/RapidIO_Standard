When implemented, this bit allows software to force the lanes of the port that are not currently being used to carry traffic, the "inactive lanes", to be enabled for testing while the "active lanes" continue to carry traffic. If this bit is not implemented it is reserved. When a 1x/Nx or 1x/Mx/Nx port is operating in 1x mode where 1 When a 1x/Mx/Nx port is operating in Mx mode where 1 8 or 16, lanes 0 through M-1 are the active lanes and lanes M through N-1 are the inactive lanes. The test mode enabled by the implementation of this bit only allows the testing of the inactive lanes that are supported by both of the connected ports. For example, if a 1x/4x/8x port is connected to a 1x/4x/16x port and the link is operating in 4x mode, only lanes 4 though 7 can be monitored using this test mode. Use of the test mode enabled by the implementation of this bit to monitor the behavior of the inactive lanes requires that this bit must be set in both ports and that all link width modes wider than the desired Mx mode must be disabled in the Port n Control CSR of both ports. Failure to meet these requirements will result in unspecified link behavior. (Modes wider than the desired Mx mode must be disabled so that the Initialization state machine ignores the asserted lane_sync signals from the lanes with forced output enables and does not attempt to enter a mode wider than Mx). If implemented, this bit shall not be asserted when the port is connected to a link that includes retimers as defined in Section 4.11.1, &quot;Retimers&quot;. 0b0: The output enables of all of the lanes controlled by the port are controlled solely by the port's Initialization state machine 0b1: The port's receivers for the inactive lanes are enabled. The port's drivers for the inactive lanes are output enabled if and only if the port's Initialization state machine is not in the SILENT or SEEK state. A continuous IDLE sequence of the same type as is in use on the active lanes shall be transmitted on the inactive lanes when their transmitters are output enabled. The IDLE sequences transmitted on the inactive lanes shall comply with all rules for that type of IDLE sequence including alignment across the inactive lanes, but they are not required to use the same bit sequences or be aligned in any way relative to the IDLE sequences transmitted on the active lanes. If IDLE2 is being used on the active lanes of the port, the inactive lanes of the port shall report their lane number and port width in the CS Field Marker and handle commands carried in the CS Field as if they were active lanes.'
